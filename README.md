Detection of Dental Abnormalities and Teeth Segmentation Using Deep Learning

Overview
This project explores the application of deep learning techniques to detect dental abnormalities and segment teeth from radiographic images. We focus on a binary classification problem to determine if a radiograph contains a disease or other abnormalities, as well as on segmenting the teeth in these images. The images used in this project were labeled by experts from the School of Dental Medicine - Tufts University, identifying conditions such as caries, periapical infections, pathological migration, altered bone height, and bony impactions of third molars.
